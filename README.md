# Memory-Allocation-Problem-MAP-Instances

This benchmark represents real and artificial instances of the memory allocation problem in embedded systems.
In fact, the instances of the latter are modified instances from the benchmark reported in [1]

The benchmark created composed of 17 instances, each instance has 3 files:

## First file <name.col>:

``` m = 3 (2 similar memory banks, and memory external)  & n=11 (data structures) ```
3 11

``` Theta```

``` t(i,j) ```
